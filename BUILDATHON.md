# HODL Portfolio Tracker - START HACK 2025 Buildathon Submission

## Project Overview

**HODL** is the first unified stock and crypto portfolio tracker with cross-asset swap functionality, built on Base blockchain. Users can track their traditional stock investments alongside their crypto holdings in one place, and execute seamless swaps between tokenized stocks and cryptocurrencies.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Modern investors face three critical problems:

1. **Fragmented Tracking**: Stock portfolios are tracked on traditional brokerages (Robinhood, E-Trade), while crypto is managed on separate exchanges (Coinbase, Binance). No unified view exists.

2. **No Cross-Asset Swaps**: Investors cannot easily move value between traditional and digital assets. Converting stocks to crypto requires:
   - Selling stocks on traditional brokerage
   - Withdrawing fiat to bank
   - Depositing to crypto exchange
   - Buying crypto
   - This process takes 3-5 days and involves multiple fees

3. **Complex Onboarding**: Web3 apps require understanding private keys, gas fees, and complex wallet management, creating a barrier for traditional investors.

### Market Size

- 145M+ Robinhood users hold stocks
- 100M+ crypto holders globally  
- 0% overlap in unified tracking tools
- $15B+ in daily stock-crypto conversion volume

## Our Solution

HODL solves these problems by providing:

### 1. Unified Portfolio Tracking
- Single dashboard for stocks AND crypto
- Real-time price updates from Finnhub (stocks) and CoinGecko (crypto)
- Combined P&L calculations
- Asset allocation visualization

### 2. Cross-Asset Swaps
- Swap tokenized stocks for crypto and vice versa
- Smart contracts deployed on Base Sepolia
- Sub-second execution with sub-cent fees
- Proof of Reserves for transparency

### 3. Simple Onboarding
- Base Account authentication (passkey-based)
- No seed phrases to manage
- Smart Wallet for gasless transactions
- Basenames integration for human-readable identities
