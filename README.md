## Proof of Reserves (Demo)

For transparency during the hackathon, tokenized stock contracts are deployed on Sepolia testnet. Anyone can independently verify supply and transactions.

- How it works and production roadmap: see the Documentation → Proof of Reserves & Custody at `/docs#proof-of-reserves`.
- Quick verification: Open each contract on Etherscan and check Contract → Read (e.g., totalSupply) and token transfers.

Sepolia demo addresses:

Sepolia demo addresses:

- [AAPL](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x334dFeb48aEC27fCb75249e77F546B687cC6aB94)
- [TSLA](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7c57A5BD9942e82Ba61C27B6141c6228c38c7487)
- [NVDA](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x532995D5C698a725B590550F67F9f90A00b352d8)
- [MSFT](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8Fe92F95f0E4CAeE9494341C2B0Fbd93A2BE89A4)
- [AMZN](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x75687E5c95e15Ba306b49869e49F017b3103AbF2)
- [GOOGL](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4833D6D51b64f93B6708088c90aB6E138b6A1547)

Coverage example: If totalSupply is 1,000 AAPL and spot price is $180, then backing should be 1,000 × $180 = $180,000 USDC. In production, reserves will be custodian-attested and oracle-verified on-chain.

**On-Chain Token Trading**  
Trade cryptocurrencies directly on Base using Uniswap V3 with ~$0.01 transaction fees. Swap ETH, USDC, DAI, WETH, and cbBTC instantly.
